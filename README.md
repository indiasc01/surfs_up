SurfsUp

Overview
In this module, we were asked to look at weather data for W. Avy in the months of June and December to determine whether opening a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year round. To help us gather the data for W. Avy, we used SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Python for this analysis.

Results
-June weather ranges from 64-85 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas December temperatures ranges from 56-83 degrees Fahrenheit 
-The average temperature in June was 75 degrees Fahrenheit, while in December it was 71 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature in June was 77 degrees 75% of the month and December was 74 degrees 75% of the month
-The standard deviation for the month of June is lower than in December as the temperatures in June are close in relation compared to December

Summary
After analyzing the temperature data in the months of June and December for W. Avy, we can conclude that although the weather in December is slightly lower than what it is in June, I think that W. Avy can still run a surf and ice cream shop in those months. An additional query I would run to gather more information on the weather, would be analyzing the precipitation levels for both June and December
